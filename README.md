# ZenToDo - Mindful Task Management

Welcome to **ZenToDo**, a simple and calming to-do list app designed to help you manage your tasks with mindfulness and peace. Inspired by zen philosophy, this app encourages you to focus on completing one task at a time, reducing stress and bringing clarity to your day.

## What Is ZenToDo?
ZenToDo is a lightweight, static web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to:
- Add tasks with optional reminder times (e.g., "12:30 PM" or "14:00").
- Mark tasks as complete with checkboxes.
- Clear completed tasks with a "Zen Mode" button, which also shows an inspiring zen quote.
- Save tasks locally in your browser so they persist across refreshes.

It’s hosted online using GitHub Pages, so you can access it anytime, anywhere, without needing to install anything!

## How to Use ZenToDo
1. Visit the live app at [https://evanwallis.github.io/ZenToDo/](https://evanwallis.github.io/ZenToDo/).
2. In the input fields, type a task and (optionally) a reminder time (e.g., "12:30 PM" or "14:00").
3. Click "Add Task" to save your task to the list.
4. Check the box next to a task when you’ve completed it.
5. Click "Zen Mode" to clear all completed tasks and enjoy a random zen quote for inspiration.
6. Refresh the page—your tasks will stay saved thanks to local storage!
